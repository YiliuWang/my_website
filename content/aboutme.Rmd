# Short Biography

## Brief Introduction

> My name is Yiliu Wang, currently reading for Masters in Analytics and Management at London Business School. Before that, I was a student at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, majoring in Electronic Information Science and Technology.
>
> Honestly speaking, it isn't quite a common choice for students in my university with similar majors to pursue a master degree in business after undergraduate, but I feel like it is what I would love to do in the future, so I just dive into it. And I would say, so far my experience at LBS is pretty fantastic (although with a lot of homework :D)! I learn new things, connect with new people, attend interesting events, get on well with my roommate and study group.

## What else?

I was born in Shanghai, China, but soon moved to Beijing and has lived there for nearly 20 years.

I love travelling, and has been to a dozen countries across 4 continents before. The pictures I attached below are Norway and Lisbon respectively. Fabulous!

> By the way, all the pictures appeared on the website are taken during my trip!

I also love food, particularly Chinese food, and recently I am learning to cook them by myself. Apart from that, the other 3 kinds of food that I enjoy pretty much is:

-   DURIAN

-   MATCHA

-   CHEESECAKE

But I am definitely open to all kinds of delicious dishes around the world:D
