<h1>Short Biography</h1>

<h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>My name is Yiliu Wang, currently reading for Masters in Analytics and Management at London Business School. Before that, I was a student at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, majoring in Electronic Information Science and Technology.</p>
<p>Honestly speaking, it isn’t quite a common choice for students in my university with similar majors to pursue a master degree in business after undergraduate, but I feel like it is what I would love to do in the future, so I just dive into it. And I would say, so far my experience at LBS is pretty fantastic (although with a lot of homework :D)! I learn new things, connect with new people, attend interesting events, get on well with my roommate and study group.</p>

<h2>What else?</h2>
<p>I was born in Shanghai, China, but soon moved to Beijing and has lived there for nearly 20 years.</p>
<p>I love travelling, and has been to a dozen countries across 4 continents before. The pictures I attached below are Norway and Lisbon respectively. Fabulous!</p>

<p>I also love food, particularly Chinese food, and recently I am learning to cook them by myself. Apart from that, the other 3 kinds of food that I enjoy pretty much is:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>DURIAN</p></li>
<li><p>MATCHA</p></li>
<li><p>CHEESECAKE</p></li>
</ul>
